# Generic Landing Page

<p>
This is a project that was developed using HTML, JS and CSS. This is a simple project with 3 screens, the landing screen, the contact screen and the thank you screen, they are simple screens but the focus was on keeping it minimalist so that it is a pleasant environment for the user.
